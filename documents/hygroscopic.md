# Drying 3D Printer Filaments: A Comprehensive Guide

## **Introduction**

One of the most important aspects of achieving high-quality 3D prints is ensuring that your filament is properly dried. Moisture-filled filament can lead to a variety of print issues that affect both the mechanical properties and the visual quality of your prints. This document will cover the drying process for common filaments like PLA and PETG, explain what happens when filaments absorb moisture, and rank the hygroscopicity (tendency to absorb moisture) of different filament types.

## **Why Dry Filament Is Crucial**

Filament absorbs moisture from the air over time, especially in humid environments. When filament with excess moisture is heated during printing, the water in the filament turns to steam, causing several undesirable effects:

- **Stringing**: Thin strands of filament are left between parts of the print due to water vapor escaping.
- **Popping or Bubbling**: Steam bubbles form inside the extruder, leading to inconsistent extrusion.
- **Poor Layer Adhesion**: The presence of moisture can weaken layer bonding, making prints more fragile.
- **Surface Imperfections**: Prints may have rough or uneven surfaces due to steam escaping during extrusion.
- **Dimensional Inaccuracy**: The expansion and contraction caused by steam can distort the final dimensions of your print.

In short, **drying filament is essential for producing high-quality prints**, as wet filament will lead to poor performance and visual defects.

## **Drying PETG Filament**

### **Recommended Drying Temperatures**
PETG is a moderately hygroscopic material and should be dried before printing if it has absorbed moisture. The typical drying temperature for PETG falls between **55°C and 70°C**. However, drying at lower temperatures over extended periods can also work.

- **Standard Drying Temperature**: 60°C - 65°C for 4-6 hours.
- **Extended Drying**: PETG can be dried at **50°C** for longer periods (e.g., 12 hours or more).

#### **Drying at Lower Temperatures**
While PETG dries best at around 60°C, it can still dry effectively at **50°C**, but it will take longer (up to 12 hours or more). Drying PETG at lower temperatures is useful if you want to avoid any risk of overheating or deforming the filament.

### **What Happens If PETG Is Wet?**
When PETG absorbs moisture, it exhibits several issues during printing:
- **Stringing**: Excessive stringing between parts due to water vapor escaping.
- **Popping Sounds**: Audible popping as steam escapes from the nozzle.
- **Surface Imperfections**: Rough or pitted surfaces on printed parts.
- **Weaker Prints**: Reduced layer adhesion and overall strength.

## **Drying PLA Filament**

### **Recommended Drying Temperatures**
PLA is less hygroscopic than PETG but can still absorb moisture over time. The recommended drying temperature for PLA is between **40°C and 50°C**, as PLA has a lower glass transition temperature (around 60°C).

- **Standard Drying Temperature**: 40°C - 50°C for 4-6 hours.

#### **Overdrying PLA**
While PLA can be overdried if exposed to excessive heat for too long (e.g., above 50°C), this is rare. Overdrying can make PLA brittle, leading to snapping during printing. However, following standard drying guidelines should prevent this issue.

### **What Happens If PLA Is Wet?**
When PLA absorbs moisture, it typically shows these symptoms:
- **Brittleness**: The filament may become brittle and prone to snapping.
- **Poor Surface Finish**: The print may have rough or uneven surfaces due to steam escaping.
- **Weak Layer Bonding**: Reduced layer adhesion leads to weaker prints.

## **Hygroscopicity of Common Filaments**

Different filaments vary in their tendency to absorb moisture from the environment. Below is a ranking of common filaments based on their hygroscopicity:

| Rank | Filament Type | Hygroscopicity (Moisture Absorption Tendency) |
|------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Nylon          | Extremely Hygroscopic                        |
| 2    | PVA            | Very Hygroscopic                             |
| 3    | TPU            | Highly Hygroscopic                           |
| 4    | PETG           | Moderately Hygroscopic                       |
| 5    | ABS            | Moderately Hygroscopic                       |
| 6    | PLA            | Low Hygroscopicity                           |

### Key Notes:
1. **Nylon** and other engineering-grade filaments like PVA are extremely hygroscopic and require careful storage in dry conditions or desiccants.
2. While materials like PLA are less prone to absorbing moisture, they still benefit from being kept dry for optimal print quality.

## **Visual Signs of Moisture in Prints**

When printing with wet filament, you may observe several visual signs indicating that the material has absorbed too much moisture:

1. **Stringing** – Thin strands of plastic between gaps in the print.
2. **Surface Roughness** – The surface may appear pitted or bumpy due to water vapor escaping during extrusion.
3. **Bubbling or Popping Sounds** – Audible sounds during extrusion as water turns into steam inside the nozzle.
4. **Cloudy or Foggy Appearance** – The print may appear less clear or have a cloudy finish (especially noticeable with transparent filaments like PETG).

## **Conclusion**

Ensuring that your filament is properly dried before printing is one of the most critical steps in achieving high-quality prints with strong mechanical properties. Moisture-filled filament leads to numerous print defects such as stringing, poor surface finish, weak layer adhesion, and dimensional inaccuracies.

To avoid these issues:
- Store your filaments in airtight containers with desiccants when not in use.
- Follow recommended drying temperatures and times for each type of filament.
- Be mindful that certain materials like Nylon are highly hygroscopic and require more frequent drying than others like PLA.

By keeping your filament dry, you will significantly improve both the visual quality and durability of your printed objects!


# Documentation: Why Overdrying Filament Is Not Good

## **Introduction**

While drying filament is crucial for achieving high-quality 3D prints, **overdrying** can also cause issues. Each type of filament has an optimal moisture content, and removing too much moisture or exposing the filament to excessive heat for long periods can degrade its properties. This document explains why overdrying is detrimental, how it affects different filaments, and what signs to look for to avoid it.

## **Why Overdrying Filament Is Harmful**

Overdrying occurs when filament is exposed to heat for too long or at temperatures higher than recommended. While drying removes unwanted moisture, prolonged exposure to heat can cause the filament to lose its flexibility, become brittle, or degrade its chemical structure. This is particularly true for filaments that contain plasticizers or other additives that help maintain flexibility and strength.

### **Key Issues Caused by Overdrying:**
1. **Brittleness**: Overdrying can make filaments like PLA and PETG brittle, causing them to snap easily during printing or even while being fed into the extruder[1][2].
2. **Degradation of Additives**: Some filaments contain plasticizers or other additives that improve flexibility and printability. Prolonged exposure to heat can cause these additives to break down, leading to poor print quality[1][2].
3. **Loss of Mechanical Properties**: Overdrying can reduce the tensile strength and flexibility of certain filaments, making the printed parts more fragile and prone to breaking under stress[2].
4. **Increased Risk of Clogging**: Brittle filament can break inside the extruder or nozzle, causing jams and clogs during printing.
5. **Inconsistent Extrusion**: Overdrying may also result in inconsistent extrusion rates due to the altered physical properties of the filament.

## **How Overdrying Affects Different Filaments**

### **PLA (Polylactic Acid)**
- **Optimal Drying Temperature**: 40°C - 50°C
- **Effects of Overdrying**: PLA is not very hygroscopic but can still absorb some moisture over time. If overdried, PLA becomes brittle and prone to snapping during printing[1]. The plasticizers in PLA may degrade with excessive heat exposure, further reducing its flexibility.
  
### **PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)**
- **Optimal Drying Temperature**: 55°C - 70°C
- **Effects of Overdrying**: PETG is moderately hygroscopic and benefits from drying before use. However, overdrying PETG at temperatures above 70°C or for too long can make it brittle and reduce its impact resistance[2].

### **Nylon (Polyamide)**
- **Optimal Drying Temperature**: 70°C - 90°C
- **Effects of Overdrying**: Nylon is extremely hygroscopic and requires careful drying. However, prolonged exposure to high temperatures can cause degradation of its polymer chains, leading to reduced strength and flexibility[2].

### **TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)**
- **Optimal Drying Temperature**: 50°C - 60°C
- **Effects of Overdrying**: TPU is highly flexible but can lose this property if overdried. Excessive drying makes TPU stiff and less elastic, which negatively impacts its ability to produce flexible parts[4].
